Data Scientist/Engineer/Analyst 📈 and Ping Pong Rookie 🏓

Greetings! Data science is my passion. From engineering complex data pipelines to unveiling hidden patterns, I **thrive** on transforming data into actionable insights. With a Master's in Applied Data Science from the University of Michigan and a B.S. in Mathematics specialized in Data Science, I wield machine learning and A.I. tools into actionable solutions.

I am a data scientist who:
* Excels in engineering data pipelines
* Effectively communicates data insights with storytelling finesse
* Navigates through various data structures--text, image, graph, numerical, and more
* Most importantly, strives to utilize data's power to create a positive impact in our world
